Insecure session handling: The code does not use secure session handling practices, such as regenerating the session ID after login or using HTTPS to encrypt the session cookie.\n4.  Predictable redirection: After a successful login, the application redirects the user to either the `/user` or `/admin` page based on their privileges.
