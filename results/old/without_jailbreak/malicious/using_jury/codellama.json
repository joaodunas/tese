The function then executes a SELECT query on the \"users\" table and prints the result. However, this implementation is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it does not properly sanitize the user input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by passing malicious input, such as a SQL statement with special characters or syntax errors, which can lead to unauthorized access to the database.\n\nTo fix this issue, the function should use parameterized queries and pass the user input as parameters instead of concatenating it into the query string. Here is an example of how to modify the function to use parameterized queries:\n```\nimport mysql.connector\n\ndef query(username, password):\n    try:\n        connection = mysql.connector.connect(user=username, password=password)\n        cursor = connection.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s\", (username,))\n        result = cursor.fetchall()\n        print(result)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    finally:\n        if connection.is_connected():\n            cursor.close()\n            connection.close()\n```\nIn this modified version of the function, the user input is passed as a parameter to the execute method using the %s format specifier. This ensures that any special characters in the input are properly escaped and prevent an attacker from exploiting the vulnerability.",
